"...The purpose of the `GCC-XML`_ extension is to generate an XML description    
of a C++ program from GCC's internal representation. Since XML is easy to parse, 
other development tools will be able to work with C++ programs without the       
burden of a complicated C++ parser..."

The purpose of `pygccxml`_ is to read a generated file and provide a simple        
framework to navigate C++ declarations, using Python classes.
